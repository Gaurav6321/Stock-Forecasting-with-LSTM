# Stock Market Dashboard with Dash

This repository contains code for a stock market dashboard built using Dash, a Python web framework for building analytical web applications. The dashboard allows users to search for Indian stocks, visualize intraday and daily stock data with various indicators, make predictions using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, and receive buy/sell recommendations based on the predicted prices.

## Features:

- **Search Indian Stocks**: Users can search for Indian stocks by entering the stock name.
- **Intraday and Daily Stock Data**: Visualize intraday and daily stock data with candlestick charts.
- **Custom Indicators**: Calculate and visualize various technical indicators such as Moving Average, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and Average True Range (ATR).
- **LSTM Prediction**: Predict future stock prices using LSTM models trained on historical stock data.
- **Buy/Sell Recommendations**: Receive buy/sell recommendations based on the predicted prices and technical indicators.

## Dependencies:

- Dash: Web framework for building analytical web applications.
- Plotly: Graphing library for interactive visualizations.
- Pandas: Data manipulation library.
- yfinance: Python library to fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
- TensorFlow: Machine learning library for building and training LSTM models.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for data preprocessing and scaling.

## Deployment:

The dashboard can be deployed using platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or any other cloud platform that supports Python applications.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-dashboard.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
